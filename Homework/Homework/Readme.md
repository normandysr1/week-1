# Instruction
* Read the code, understand it, think hard how it works.
* Change the code such that it will accept a number from command line, then show the result.
* Answer the questions below

# Questions
* Why we need "if-else" in function process?

Answer: This is a factorial calculator using the recursion. by calling itself within the program text and create the loop.
We need if-else in the function to control , keep the recursion going and to stop the recursion when the require conditions 
are met to get the correct result and without if-else the StackOverFlow error would occur bacause of infinite loop.

 and prevent incorrect answer when enter factorial of 0. (the correct answer is 1 but without if-else the result 'll be different)
